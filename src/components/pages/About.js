  <p>
    I have experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js,
    Handlebars.js, React.js, Mongo, GraphQL, and MySQL. I'm currently in the Georgia Tech
    Coding Bootcamp with plans to secure a job in front-end, back-end, or full
    stack web development in June of 2022. As I have taught seniors in AP
    Calculus the last several years, I have been inspired. I continue to send
    brilliant students to study and pursue careers in multiple STEM fields, and
    I want to follow them. That is why Iâ€™m in the GT coding bootcamp while I
    finish this school year teaching. I want to apply my logic and
    problem-solving abilities to create. I want to leverage my passion for
    education in new avenues, including making myself a life-long learner in the
    constantly changing tech world.
