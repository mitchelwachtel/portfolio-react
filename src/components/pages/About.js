      <p>
        I have experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js,
        Handlebars.js, React.js, Mongo and MySQL. I'm currently in the Georgia
        Tech Coding Bootcamp with plans to secure a job in front-end, back-end,
        or full stack web development in June of 2022. As I have taught seniors
        in AP Calculus the last several years, I have been inspired. I continue
        to send brilliant students to study and pursue careers in multiple STEM
        fields, and I want to follow them. That is why Iâ€™m in the GT coding
        bootcamp while I finish this school year teaching. I want to apply my
        logic and problem-solving abilities to create. I want to leverage my
        passion for education in new avenues, including making myself a
        life-long learner in the constantly changing tech world.
